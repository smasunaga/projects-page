		<p>The three projects I'm pitching are all related to my master's project on the insufficient funding available for Alzheimer's research.</p>
		<h3>Interactive chart showing total funding for Alzheimer's research</h3>
		<p>Alzheimer's disease is the sixth leading cause of death in America and currently affects about 5.4 million people. By 2050, that number is expected to double, leading to a total of $1.2 trillion in healthcare costs. There is no cure, and no way of even significantly slowing this disease's progress. Yet funding for Alzheimer's research lags behind other such prevalent diseases as cancer and HIV/AIDS.<br>
		<br>Alzheimer's disease research currently pulls in funding from a variety of sources, including federal agencies, private organizations like the Alzheimer's Association, venture capital and pharmaceutical companies. For my final project, I'd like to create an interactive map using D3 that will show all of the different kinds of funding and compare them to each other to see which sector is giving the most money. I'd also like to be able to use a timelapse function to show how funding from the various groups have changed over time.<br>
		<br>There's currently a <a href="http://iadrp.nia.nih.gov/cadro-web/visualizeData"> map</a> very much like this in place that was created by the National Alzheimer's Project Act, a federal office dedicated to Alzheimer's planning, but it's very reader-unfriendly and too scientific to be used by the general public. It also only shows federal spending and a section of the private sector.<br>
		<br>Most of the federal data and private sector dad I need is located on the <a href="http://iadrp.nia.nih.gov/cadro-web/"> International Alzheimer's Disease Research Portfolio</a> in an excel document. I'm planning to get pharmaceutical and venture capital spending data from the companies themselves, or from the Alzheimer's Association, which is the main advocacy and research organization for the disease. I'm planning to talk to representatives of each of these sectors to see why funding has changed over time and where they see it going in the future in response to the upcoming crisis.<br>
		<br>I'll probably need to learn how to better use Excel to mine data, and also possibly extract data from PDFs, if that's how I get data from the pharmaceutical companies/VCs. I'll also have to learn how to make a slider and create a timelapse to show spending over time.<br>
		<br>This chart will be published with my master's project, which will be unleashed on the world via its own website in May.</p><br>
		
		<h3>Alzheimer's federal funding compared to other diseases</h3>
		<p>Alzheimer's disease research receives much less federal funding than diseases like cancer, HIV/AIDS and even nutrition studies. As part of my master's project, I'd like to make an interactive line chart showing how much federal funding goes toward every disease supported by the National Institute of Health and how that has changed over time.<br>
		<br>I currently have this data from the <a href="http://report.nih.gov/categorical_spending.aspx">NIH website</a>, and its also available in Excel form. It goes back several years, and I'm envisioning this graph to look very similar to the one we did on strikeouts, with drop-down menus for various diseases and the ability to put several diseases (possibly the ones that you're most likely to contract) on the graph at any time.<br>
		<br>In terms of human sources, I'm planning to contact someone from the NIH who is knowledgeable about funding, and I've already talked to several researchers who have either received or applied for federal grants and have talked to me about how grant funding has changed over time and how they're dealt with shrinking resources.<br>
		<br>To make this graph a reality, I'll have to scrape the NIH site and also learn d3 nesting(). I'll also have to work more on my design to make this graph interesting and informative.<br>
		<br>This graph would be published as part of my master's project<br></p>
		
		<h3>Alzheimer's drug trials over the years</h3>
		<p>
		Private funding for Alzheimer's disease has been hindered by many high-profile drug trial failures over the years, whether it was a promising cure or a potential preventative treatment.<br>
		<br>In this project, I'd like to do a bar chart showing how many clinical Alzheimer's drug trials there are per year and how that number has changed over time. This data is available on <a href="www.clinicaltrials.gov">clinicaltrials.gov</a> from September 2008.<br>
		<br>In terms of human sources, I've already spoken with some researchers from various universities about their own research, the state of Alzheimer's research today, and where they think it will be in the future. I'm also planning to speak to some of the earliest Alzheimer's researchers to get their overall thoughts on how the field has changed and where it is going. An interview with the Alzheimer's Association, which is the main advocacy group for the disease, would also be helpful.<br>
		<br>Since this project is highly "on the web" rather than "of the web," the main draw and learning lesson here for me would be scraping the clinical trials website, since I really don't want to go through who-knows-how-many pages of clinical trial results and postings.<br>
		<br>This will be published with my master's project
